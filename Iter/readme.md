# Iterables and Iterators

An Iterable is a class that implements the __iter__ method
the __iter__ method returns an Iterator


An Iterator is a class that implements the __next__ method
the __next__

In a for loop the __iter__ is called first, then the resulting
Iterator's __next__ method is called each iteration

### Advantages of using Iterators

- Cleaner code
- Iterators can work with infinite sequences
- Iterators save resources
